## Testing Results for PR #8826 (Taquito Upgrade to v21.0.0)

### Key Journey & Findings

1. Initial Testing Challenges
   - Encountered network connectivity issues with Ledger's Tezos node
   - Basic operations failed on both main and Taquito v21 branches
   - Determined issues were infrastructure-related, not code-related

2. Protocol Compatibility Investigation
   - Successfully tested with Ghostnet for basic operations
   - Discovered protocol mismatch: Ghostnet running Paris protocol (020)
   - Identified need for Quebec protocol compatibility testing

3. Testing Environment Evolution
   - Moved from public endpoints to local node setup
   - Successfully configured local Quebecnet node
   - Implemented proper CORS and RPC access for Ledger Live Desktop

4. Final Success Confirmation
   - Local node fully operational with Quebec protocol
   - Successfully registered as baker with required stake
   - Completed end-to-end delegation through Ledger Live Desktop
   - Verified full functionality of Taquito v21 upgrade

### Technical Details
- Protocol: `PsQuebecnLByd3JwTiGadoG4nGWi3HYiLXUjkibeFV8dCFeVMUg`
- Chain ID: `NetXuTeGinLEqxp`
- Environment: Local node + Quebecnet configuration
- Octez Node Startup Command:
  ```bash
  octez-node run --rpc-addr 0.0.0.0:8732 --allow-all-rpc=0.0.0.0:8732 --cors-origin='*' --cors-header='content-type' --cors-header='range' --cors-header='authorization' --cors-header='content-length' --cors-header='accept' --cors-header='origin' --cors-header='x-requested-with' --history-mode rolling --synchronisation-threshold=0 --force-history-mode-switch
  ```
- LLD Startup Command:
  ```bash
  DISPLAY=:0 API_TEZOS_NODE=http://localhost:8732 API_TEZOS_TZKT_API=https://api.quebecnet.tzkt.io DEBUG=*,-babel*,-electron*,-vite* LEDGER_DEBUG_ALL=1 LEDGER_LOG_LEVEL=debug pnpm desktop start
  ```

### Final Conclusions
1. Taquito v21 upgrade is functioning correctly
2. Initial issues were related to infrastructure, not the upgrade
3. Quebec protocol delegation features work as expected
4. Local node setup provides reliable testing environment

### Recommendations
1. Proceed with Taquito v21 upgrade
2. Consider maintaining local nodes for protocol testing
3. Monitor upcoming Ghostnet upgrade (January 12th) for additional testing opportunities
4. Document protocol-specific requirements for future upgrades
