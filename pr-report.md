## Address Validation Testing Results for PR #8826 (Taquito v21 Upgrade)

### Test Environment
- Created test script to validate Tezos addresses
- Tested both main branch (Taquito v20) and PR branch (Taquito v21)
- Used various address types and formats for comparison

### Test Script
const { validateAddress } = require("@taquito/utils");

const addresses = [
  "tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb",  // Valid tz1
  "tz2ThQp4xjYqB3yY1ZxbkgNEgRs6rrcfACfS",  // Valid tz2
  "tz1invalid",                             // Invalid
  "notanaddress",                           // Completely invalid
  "tz1" + "0".repeat(33)                    // Wrong length
];

addresses.forEach(addr => {
  const result = validateAddress(addr);
  console.log(`Testing address: ${addr}`);
  console.log(`Result: ${result} (${interpretResult(result)})\n`);
});

function interpretResult(code) {
  switch(code) {
    case 3: return "Valid";
    case 1: return "Invalid - Correct prefix only";
    case 0: return "Invalid";
    default: return "Unknown result";
  }
}

### Test Results
Both versions (v20 and v21) showed identical behavior:

1. tz1 Addresses:
   - Valid tz1 address (tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb) → Result: 3 (Valid)
   - Properly validates correct tz1 addresses

2. tz2 Addresses:
   - Valid tz2 address (tz2ThQp4xjYqB3yY1ZxbkgNEgRs6rrcfACfS) → Result: 1 (Invalid - Correct prefix only)
   - Note: This behavior exists in both versions

3. Invalid Addresses:
   - "tz1invalid" → Result: 1 (Invalid - Correct prefix only)
   - "notanaddress" → Result: 0 (Invalid)
   - Malformed address → Result: 1 (Invalid - Correct prefix only)

### Conclusions
1. No regressions introduced by Taquito v21 upgrade for address validation
2. Existing behavior with tz2 addresses is preserved
3. Address validation logic remains consistent between versions

### Notes
- The tz2 address validation behavior might need investigation as a separate issue
- This is not a regression introduced by the PR

## Operation Construction Testing Results for PR #8826 (Taquito v21 Upgrade)

## Testing Results for PR #8826 (Taquito Upgrade to v21.0.0)

### Environment
- Testing on Ubuntu with physical Ledger Nano S
- Successfully built and ran both main and support/taquitoV21 branches
- Able to connect device and create/access Tezos account

### Issues Found (Not PR-Specific)
1. Send Operation:
   - Error: `GET https://xtz-node.api.live.ledger.com/chains/main/blocks/head/context/constants TypeError: Failed to fetch`
   - Occurs on both main and Taquito upgrade branches
   - Suggests infrastructure/connectivity issue with Ledger's Tezos node

### Alternative Endpoint Testing
1. Successful Operation with Ghostnet:
   - Overrode default endpoints with:
     ```
     API_TEZOS_NODE=https://ghostnet.ecadinfra.com
     API_TEZOS_TZKT_API=https://api.ghostnet.tzkt.io
     ```
   - Send operation completed successfully
   - Confirms Taquito v21 functionality works correctly
   - Validates that issues are infrastructure-related, not code-related

2. Delegation Testing with Alternative Endpoints:
   - Attempted to test delegation/earn feature
   - Baker list loaded successfully
   - Encountered error: `proto.020-PsParisC.delegate.no_deletion`
   - Error indicates Ghostnet is running Paris protocol (020)
   - Test environment should use Quebecnet for protocol compatibility
   - Not a Taquito v21 issue but a protocol version mismatch

3. Quebecnet Protocol Information:
   - Protocol: `PsQuebecnLByd3JwTiGadoG4nGWi3HYiLXUjkibeFV8dCFeVMUg`
   - Chain ID: `NetXuTeGinLEqxp`

     ```
     API_TEZOS_NODE=https://rpc.quebecnet.teztnets.com
     API_TEZOS_TZKT_API=https://api.quebecnet.tzkt.io
     ```
   - Endpoint Status:
     - RPC endpoint confirmed active (block level 1224739)
     - Protocol and chain ID verified
     - Previous endpoint had operation simulation failures
   - Ready for protocol compatibility testing

### Conclusions
- Issues appear to be infrastructure-related rather than Taquito upgrade specific
- Basic account creation and balance viewing works
- Network connectivity to Ledger's Tezos services needs investigation
- Core Tezos functionality works correctly when using alternative endpoints
- Test environment needs to match target protocol version
